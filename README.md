# VAPA-Gallery-VR
## The Visual and Performing Arts Gallery at SC in Virtual Environment!

Me and a talented friend of mine, Andreas Varnauskas (Multimedia Design major), collaborated on this as our final project for Advanced Design Studio class. We used Unity, C#, Autodesk MAYA for this project.

We incorporated the art works of our professors and added our touch of what we think the Gallery should look like.

## Professor InDelicato trying the VR experience for the first time!
